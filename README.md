# Game Description
"Snail Mail" is a top-down, grid-based puzzle game that follows Shelly, a mail-delivering snail, as she pushes packages and makes connections with her customers. Puzzles gradually get more difficult as Shelly encounters boxes with new properties and interesting interactions. Will Shelly succeed in delivering the mail and making her customers happy? Play our game, “Snail Mail,” to find out!
